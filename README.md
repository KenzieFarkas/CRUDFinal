The Prupose:

The information needed to use this website is basic undertanding of what lululemon is and what you would like to order from lululemon. I created this website so that when people make orders in lululemon they can look them up and delete past history. 
Sometimes people don't like when you can see what they have ordered online and his creates a way for people to get rid of it. 

Behind the Scenes: 

The types of code I used were php and html, I chose these two becuase they seemed to be the most effiecent and I had a properly working HTML file from a previous project. A majority of the code from this project was taken from online sources on cloud 9 and edited in order to fit the needs of my tables and databases. 

About the Author: 

My name is Mackenzie Farkas and I am a junior at Shakopee High School, this is my first class where I have learned many different languages of code and it has been a great expirence. Although this is not my first project using HTML or PHP I feel like I have learned more through this project than I have from any other project I have taken part of this year. I am always interested in learning new coding languages becuase once you know one picking up on the other ones is not as hard as it may seem. My favorite language I have learned is html becuase it seems to be the most straight forword, it is alsothe first language I have learned in deapth. 

How to: 

The way you use this website is pretty simple, you fill out the informationfor first name and last name and then using the drop downs pick which type of legging and in which color you want it and then you submit the file. After you have subbmitted your order form it will bring you to a page that notifies you that your order has been sent to the database. The other way this website is used is to look up previous files by last name to either delete them or update them. There is a text box you type your last name into and hit the find button, from here you may make your changes.
